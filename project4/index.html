<h2>PANTENE IS ON A MISSION TO GIVE MORE PEOPLE, MORE GREAT HAIR DAYS, BECAUSE HAIR IS ALWAYS MORE THAN “JUST HAIR.”</h2>
<p class="first_paragraph" />Landmark global research conducted by Pantene with Dr. Marianne LaFrance, Ph.D., Professor at Yale University and social psychologist Dr. Adam Galinsky, Ph.D., Professor of Business and Chair of Management Division at Columbia Business School found that hair is the #1 way women express their identity and sense of self to the world. Great hair can kickstart a great day. 
<p />Great hair goes beyond looking good: it impacts how we each perceive ourselves. When you feel good about your hair, you feel happier, more true to “you” great hair makes you feel more competent and more confident, more joyful and more creative.
<p />
<h3>Our products must be
SAFE AND EFFECTIVE</h3>

<p />Our priority: Responsible Science that helps you achieve your healthiest, best hair ever. For this, we use active Pro-V Nutrients that absorb deeply to nourish hair inside and out. Sometimes our nutrients are natural ingredients that yield great results, and sometimes they are lab-developed ingredients when they’re the best choice. Always, they are responsibly developed to be good for hair and good for our natural resources – we work to learn from them but not deplete them.

<h1 class="how_use_mask">How to use a hair mask?</h1>

<p />If you are now ready to incorporate a mask into your hair care routine and want to know how, follow this step-by-step guide on how to use a hair mask at home:

<h3>1. Wash your hair</h3>

<p>The first step in your masking routine is to make sure your hair is completely clean and ready to soak up the key ingredients of your mask. If your hair is in bad condition or feeling especially dry, use conditioner as usual before your mask. If not, don’t worry about it as you’ll be replenishing moisture with your mask. To ensure you’re really nailing this step, read our guides on how to choose a shampoo for your hair type and how to shampoo your hair properly.</p>

<h3>2. Soak up the excess water, leaving your hair damp</h3>

<p>For better results, it’s recommended to use a hair mask to damp hair, not dry or soaking wet hair. This will help the ingredients penetrate the inside of the strand. You can use a microfibre towel to draw water from your hair quickly without damaging it with friction. If you don’t have one, a cotton t-shirt works just as well.</p>

<h3>3. Apply your mask</h3>

<p>Now for the fun part, how to apply a hair mask! Focusing on the mid lengths and ends of your hair only, gently massage the product into your hair in a downwards motion for 30 seconds. This will help to the product penetrate and seal the cuticle for more smoothness and shine.</p>

<p>There’s no need to go overboard with your mask, as a little product goes a long way. Start by smoothing a coin sized amount through your mid lengths and ends, adding a little more if this does not stretch to cover all your hair.</p>

<h3>4. Leave the mask to soak in for 3-5 minutes</h3>

<p>For best results follow the recommended leave-on time on the pack. About 3-5 minutes is more than enough time for your hair mask to work its magic. It doesn’t hurt to leave a mask on your hair longer than the instructions. Some like to leave the hair mask overnight, wrapping the hair in a towel and rinse it in the morning. This isn’t a “must do step”, but it can improve the results of your mask.</p>

<h3>5. Rinse thoroughly</h3>

<p>Hair masks contain powerful nourishing ingredients that reset the right amount of moisture into your hair. After soaking in, you need to carefully rinse off, so your hair is not weighted down or get greasy quicker. </p>

Now you know how to use a hair mask, let’s get down to which you should stock up on.</p>
